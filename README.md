The project involves using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze mammogram images and classify them into benign or malignant categories. The CNN will be trained on a large dataset of labeled mammogram images to learn the patterns and features indicative of breast cancer. The project will use a dataset of mammogram images, possibly sourced from publicly available datasets or hospitals with appropriate permissions. The dataset will be preprocessed to enhance image quality and remove noise.

Purpose of This Project:
Trying my hands on DEEP LEARNING, but seriously speaking it is needed to procced to the next stage and I have started moving forward to it. Improving each day in machine learnng and now deep learning, but this will not end with becoming well known in deeo learnig I after this My sights on MLops, thogh that for future, lets hope good for it, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!
## ðŸ›  Skills
Python, ML, data science, java, Ms Office


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm under graduat in IT I'm doing it from sindh  agriculture university form pakistan,
I'm very intersted in the filled of AI and it's subfilled Machine Learninig this project is my first project shows that what I have learned this few days, though it's not good as intermediate or master level even I can't compare it to other's and I'm stll learning, You may find some mistakes in my project and I Will be happy if you inform me about them but I'm still in leaning stage, And I will improve.
